# Bot Behavior Changes

## üîÑ Updated: Bot Now Responds to Anyone

### Previous Behavior:
- Only responded when PyQwerty (ID: 707614458826194955) sent messages
- 30% base response probability

### New Behavior:
- **Responds to ANY user** in the server as PyQwerty
- 25% base response probability (slightly lower since responding to everyone)
- **Higher response rates:**
  - Direct bot mentions: +60% (85% total chance)
  - Other mentions: +30% 
  - Questions: +30%
  - Gaming topics: +30%
  - Long gaps: +20%

## üéØ Response Examples

**Anyone can trigger responses:**
```
User1: "anyone down for valorant?"
PyQwerty Bot: "im down but my internet is trash rn"

User2: "@PyQwerty what's your rank?"
PyQwerty Bot: "<@User2> hardstuck gold bro"

User3: "just aced!"
PyQwerty Bot: "fire"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Admin Controls
- `!py pause/resume/status` commands work for:
  - Original PyQwerty user (ID: 707614458826194955)
  - Server administrators

## üîß Technical Changes
- Removed user ID restriction in `should_respond()`
- Adjusted response probabilities for broader audience
- Enhanced mention detection (bot vs other mentions)
- Updated logging to show which user triggered response
- **Added self-mention removal**: Bot will never mention itself in responses

## üõ†Ô∏è Latest Updates: Reply System & Guaranteed Mentions Response

### 1. Always Respond to Mentions
- **Change**: Bot now **always responds** when directly mentioned (100% probability)
- **Before**: 85% chance to respond to mentions  
- **After**: 100% chance to respond to mentions

### 2. Reply System Instead of Mentions
- **Problem**: Bot included user mentions in responses
- **Solution**: Now uses Discord's **reply feature** instead of mentions
- **Result**: Cleaner responses + clear conversation threading

**How it works:**
```
User: "@PyQwerty what's your rank?"
Bot: [REPLIES to message] "hardstuck gold bro"
```

**Reply triggers:**
- Direct mentions of bot (always)
- Questions being answered  
- LLM response originally contained mentions
- Continuing conversation with same user

### 3. Complete Mention Removal
- **Removed**: All user mentions from responses (`<@user_id>`)
- **Replaced with**: Discord reply system for better UX

**Example:**
```
‚ùå Before: "<@user_id> nah bro that's crazy"
‚úÖ After:  [Reply] "nah bro that's crazy"
```

The bot maintains the same authentic PyQwerty persona and style validation - it just responds to anyone now instead of only PyQwerty!
